<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The DeviceDispense resource is used to capture the assignment of a Device to a patient or practitioner for the purpose of care.
The dispense may include a description of the device and the instructions for using the device. The request to initiate a DeviceDispense may be via a <a href="devicerequest.html">DeviceRequest</a> resource but may be implicitly triggered by for example a <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a>, or without any request.  The details of the clinical application of the dispensed device may be captured in a Procedure resource.
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
To determine the purchase date, a search of DeviceRequest, SupplyRequest, DeviceDispense, or SupplyDelivery as defined in an implementation guide can be done , as the context of the use case actually determines which date of either resource is considered the purchase date.
