  <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
  <p>A research subject is typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, drug product or biological product, substance, or a tissue or other sort of sample. Research subject can also be a group or part of any of the above.</p>
  <p>The ResearchSubject resource describes information about the subject in the context of a research study.</p>
  <p>Human research subjects are traceable to a particular person but their identifying characteristics are usually hidden to protect study integrity and to protect the subject's privacy.</p>
  <p>Note that in a human drug trial the human is the research subject even though the drug is what is being investigated.</p>
  <p>The scope of ResearchSubject is intended to support the following use cases:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Humans and Animals for Clinical and Pre-clinical Trials</li>
   <li>Drug Products for Stability Studies and other Tests</li>
   <li>Devices for non-clinical laboratory studies - in-vivo and in-vitro</li>
   <li>Tissue Sample for bench science studies</li>
  </ul>
