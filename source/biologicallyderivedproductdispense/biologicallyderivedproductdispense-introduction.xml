<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource has boundaries with MedicationDispense and DeviceDispense. BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense should be used when the product is a biologic derived from a human donor or another biological entity.
Biologics prepared from large pool donor sources such as human albumin solutions or immune globulin preparations are often handled through pharmacy and MedicationDispense may be more appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The request to initiate a BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense may be via a <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
The details of the clinical application of the dispensed product may be captured in a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>resource.
